/**
 * A condition that has minimal requirements on Java code. The implementation does not perform
 * memory allocation, exception unwinding, or other complicated operations. This allows it to be
 * used in early startup and shutdown phases of the VM, as well as to coordinate garbage collection.
 * <p>
 * It is not possible to allocate new VM conditions at run time. All VM conditions must be allocated
 * during image generation. They are initialized during startup of the VM, i.e., every VM condition
 * consumes resources and contributes to VM startup time.
 * <p>
 * This class is a hosted-only placeholder. Image building replaces reachable instances with
 * {@link RuntimeVMCondition} objects.
