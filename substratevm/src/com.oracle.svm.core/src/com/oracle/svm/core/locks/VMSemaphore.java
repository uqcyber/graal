 * A semaphore that has minimal requirements on Java code. The implementation does not perform
 * memory allocation, exception unwinding, or other complicated operations. This allows it to be
 * used in early startup and shutdown phases of the VM, as well as to coordinate garbage collection.
 * <p>
 * Higher-level code that does not have these restrictions should use regular semaphores from the
 * JDK instead, i.e., implementations of {@link java.util.concurrent.Semaphore}.
 * <p>
 * It is not possible to allocate new VM semaphores at run time. All VM semaphores must be allocated
 * during image generation.
 * <p>
 * This class is a hosted-only placeholder. Image building replaces reachable instances with
 * {@link RuntimeVMSemaphore} objects.
